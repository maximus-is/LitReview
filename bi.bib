We show theoretically, numerically, and empirically that range-based volatility proxies are not only highly efficient, but also approximately Gaussian and robust to microstructure noise. Hence range-based Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimation produces highly efficient estimates of stochastic volatility models and extractions of latent volatility. We use our method to examine the dynamics of daily exchange rate volatility and find the evidence points strongly toward two-factor models with one highly persistent factor and one quickly mean-reverting factor.

They show that log range is approximately normal, yet fail to conduct tests of normality on the results, merely suggesting that a visual comparison with a normal distribution is suggestive of normality, as are skewness of 0.17 and kurtosis of 2.80. 
        
The authors find that simple Geometric Brownian Motion is not sufficient to explain the autocorrelation of volatility and its variance as found in foreign exchange data.
        
Range based estimators are more effcient than squared-return estimators in the presence of bid-ask bounce, as the observed value may be higher than the true value when the price realises the ask price, and the opposite for the bid price.},

Building on the theory of continuous-time arbitrage-free price processes and the theory of quadratic variation, we develop formal links between realized volatility and the conditional covariance matrix. Next, using continuously recorded observations for the Deutschemark/Dollar and Yen/Dollar spot exchange rates, we find that forecasts from a simple long-memory Gaussian vector autoregression for the logarithmic daily realized volatilities perform admirably. Moreover, the vector autoregressive volatility forecast, coupled with a parametric lognormal-normal mixture distribution produces well-calibrated density forecasts of future returns, and correspondingly accurate quantile predictions. Our results hold promise for practical modeling and forecasting of the large covariance matrices relevant in asset pricing, asset allocation, and financial risk management applications.

Our estimates, termed realized volatilities and correlations, are not only model-free, but also approximately free of measurement error under general conditions, which we discuss in detail. Hence, for practical purposes, we may treat the exchange rate volatilities and correlations as observed rather than latent. We do so, and we characterize their joint distribution, both unconditionally and conditionally. Noteworthy results include a simple normality-inducing volatility transformation, high contemporaneous correlation across volatilities, high correlation between correlation and volatilities, pronounced and persistent dynamics in volatilities and correlations, evidence of long-memory dynamics in volatilities and correlations, and remarkably precise scaling laws under temporal aggregation.

Our results build on the eigenfunction representation of the general stochastic volatility class of models developed byMeddahi (2001). In addition to traditional realized volatility measures and the role of the underlying sampling frequencies, we also explore the forecasting performance of several alternative volatility measures designed to mitigate the impact of the microstructure noise. Our analysis is facilitated by a simple unified quadratic form representation for all these estimators. Our results suggest that the detrimental impact of the noise on forecast accuracy can be substantial. Moreover, the linear forecasts based on a simple-to-implement ‘average’ (or ‘subsampled’) estimator obtained by averaging standard sparsely sampled realized volatility measures generally perform on par with the best alternative robust measures.},

The weights can be chosen to achieve the best possible rate of convergence and to have an asymptotic variance which is close to that of the maximum likelihood estimator in the parametric version of this problem. Realised kernels can also be selected to (i) be analysed using endogenously spaced data such as that in databases on transactions, (ii) allow for market frictions which are endogenous, (iii) allow for temporally dependent noise.

Initially, an examination of intraday returns on S\&P 500 Index Futures reveals that returns can be characterised by heteroscedasticity and time-varying autocorrelation. After reviewing a number of daily realised volatility estimators cited in the literature, it is concluded that these estimators are based upon a number of restrictive assumptions in regard to the data generating process for intraday returns. We use a weak set of assumptions about the data generating process for intraday returns, including transaction returns, given in den Haan and Levin [den Haan, W.J., Levin, A., 1996. Inferences from parametric and non-parametric covariance matrix estimation procedures, Working paper, NBER, 195.], which allows for heteroscedasticity and time-varying autocorrelation in intraday returns. These assumptions allow the VARHAC estimator to be employed in the estimation of daily realised volatility. An empirical analysis of the VARHAC daily volatility estimator employing intraday transaction returns concludes that this estimator performs well in comparison to other estimators cited in the literature.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compare the performance of a daily ARCH type model (which uses daily returns) with the performance of a model based on the daily realized volatility (which uses intraday returns) when the 1-day ahead value-at-risk (VaR) is to be computed. While the VaR specification based on a long memory skewed Student model for the daily realized volatility provides adequate 1-day-ahead VaR forecasts for two stock indexes (the CAC40 and SP500) and two exchange rate returns (the YEN–USD and DEM–USD), it does not really improve on the performance of a VaR model based on the skewed Student APARCH model and estimated using daily data only. Thus both methods seem to be equivalent. This paper also shows that daily returns standardized by the square root of the 1-day-ahead forecast of the daily realized volatility are not normally distributed.},

We show that kernel-based estimators can unearth important characteristics of marketmicrostructure noise and that a simple kernel-based estimator dominates the RV for the estimation of integrated variance (IV). An empirical analysis of the Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks reveals that market microstructure noise is time-dependent and correlated with increments in the efficient price. This has important implications for volatility estimation based on high-frequency data. Finally, we apply cointegration techniques to decompose transaction prices and bid-ask quotes into an estimate of the efficient price and noise. This framework enables us to study the dynamic effects on transaction prices and quotes caused by changes in the efficient price.},

abstract = {We are interested in the rate of convergence of the Euler scheme approximation of the solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by a general (possibly discontinuous) semimartingale, and by the asymptotic behavior of the associated normalized error. It is well known that for Ito's equations the rate is \$1/\backslash sqrt\{n\}\$ ; we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for this rate to be \$1/\backslash sqrt\{n\}\$ when the driving semimartingale is a continuous martingale, or a continuous semimartingale under a mild additional assumption; we also prove that in these cases the normalized error processes converge in law. The rate can also differ from \$1/\backslash sqrt\{n\}\$ : this is the case for instance if the driving process is deterministic, or if it is a Levy process without a Brownian component. It is again \$1/\backslash sqrt\{n\}\$ when the driving process is Levy with a nonvanishing Brownian component, but then the normalized error processes converge in law in the finite-dimensional sense only, while the discretized normalized error processes converge in law in the Skorohod sense, and the limit is given an explicit form.

In addition, we suggest a bias-correction procedure to account for the effects of microstructure frictions based upon scaling the realized range with the average level of the daily range. Simulation experiments demonstrate that for plausible levels of non-trading and bid–ask bounce the realized range has a lower mean-squared error than the realized variance, including variants thereof that are robust to microstructure noise. Empirical analysis of the S\&P500 index-futures and the S\&P100 constituents confirms the potential of the realized range.},

First, we analyze properties of these estimators and find that the best estimator is the Garman–Klass (1980) estimator. Second, we correct some mistakes in existing literature. Third, the use of the Garman–Klass estimator allows us to obtain an interesting result: returns normalized by their standard deviations are approximately normally distributed.

abstract = {Recent advances in financial econometrics have led to the development of new estimators of asset price variability using frequently-sampled price data, known as “realised volatility estimators” or simply “realised measures”. These estimators rely on a variety of different assumptions and take many different functional forms. Motivated by the empirical success of combination forecasts, this paper presents a novel approach for combining individual realised measures to form new estimators of price variability. In an application to high frequency IBM price data over the period 1996–2008, we consider 32 different realised measures from 8 distinct classes of estimators. We find that a simple equally-weighted average of these estimators cannot generally be out-performed, in terms of accuracy, by any individual estimator. Moreover, we find that none of the individual estimators encompasses the information in all other estimators, providing further support for the use of combination realised measures.},

abstract = {This paper examines the estimation and forecasting performance of range-based volatility estimators for stocks, with two-scales realized volatility as the benchmark. There is evidence that the daily range-based estimators provide an efficient and low-bias alternative to the return-based estimators. These are not downwardly biased in the presence of negative autocorrelation and low liquidity, as generally suspected. The drift is a major cause of the poor performance of Parkinson's estimator. The forecasts of volatility with these estimators are about as efficient as those with the benchmark itself but are more biased. The forecasts based on realized range are only marginally better on the criterion of bias and are about as efficient. Considering their simplicity and lower data requirement, the daily range-based estimators appear to be more desirable. These results are particularly relevant for the option valuation and the risk management of derivative markets. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Range based estimators are biased downwards when considering that for discrete trading, the observed value will be lower than the true value. 
        
The realized range-based volatility of Martens and Dijk can reduce the effect of drift on Parkinson's range estimator, as for smaller intervals, the drift will become negligible.
        
Realized volatility assumes uncorrelated intraday returns. Zhang (2005) uses a low frequency and a high frequency estimate of realized volatility, assuming that prices are negatively correlated at the first order, to mitigate the effects of microstructure noise.
        
RRV can be affected by jumps in the price, resulting in an underestimate of volatility.},

The descriptive statistics and the long-memory estimations are compared between the daily and realized range-based estimators, and across each group as well. The realized range-based estimators are also compared in terms of the properties of the jump components of volatility. Moreover, the relevant effects of jumps on volatility are assessed by the use of the class of Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) models.},

abstract = {This article examines the empirical bias and efficiency of Parkinson's extreme-value variance estimator for common stocks using an extensive NYSE/AMEX data base. Bias and efficiency are analyzed as a function of stock price level and trading volume. The results are sensitive to outliers in daily high and low prices. After an outlier screen is applied to the data, the efficiency of the extreme-value estimator significantly exceeds that of the close-close estimator for most price and volume groups.

@article{DennisYang2000,
abstract = {We present a new volatility estimator based on multiple periods of high, low, open, and close prices in a historical time series. The new estimator has the following nice properties: it is (a) unbiased in the continuous limit, (b) independent of the drift, (c) consistent in dealing with opening price jumps. Furthermore, it has the smallest variance among all estimators with similar properties. The improvement of accuracy over the classical close‐to‐close estimator is dramatic for real‐life time series.

@article{Zhang2005,
abstract = {It is a common practice in finance to estimate volatility from the sum of frequently sampled squared returns. However, market microstructure poses challenges to this estimation approach, as evidenced by recent empirical studies in finance. The present work attempts to lay out theoretical grounds that reconcile continuous-time modeling and discrete-time samples. We propose an estimation approach that takes advantage of the rich sources in tick-by-tick data while preserving the continuous-time assumption on the underlying returns. Under our framework, it becomes clear why and where the "usual" volatility estimator fails when the returns are sampled at the highest frequencies. If the noise is asymptotically small, our work provides a way of finding the optimal sampling frequency. A better approach, the "two-scales estimator," works for any size of the noise.

@article{Zhou1996,
abstract = {Exchange rates, like many other financial time series, display substantial heteroscedasticity. This poses obstacles in detecting trends and changes. Understanding volatility becomes extremely important in studying financial time series. Unfortunately, estimating volatility from low-frequency data, such as daily, weekly, or monthly observations, is very difficult. The recent availability of ultra-high-frequency observations, such as tick-by-tick data, to large financial institutions creates a new possibility for the analysis of volatile time series. This article uses tick-by-tick foreign-exchange rates to explore this new type of data. Unlike low-frequency data, high-frequency data have extremely high negative first-order autocorrelation in their return. In this article, I propose a model that can explain the negative autocorrelation and a volatility estimator for high-frequency data. The daily and hourly volatility estimates of exchange rate show some interesting patterns. CR  - Copyright \&\#169; 1996 American Statistical Association},

The model allows arbitrary correlation between volatility and spot-asset returns. I introduce stochastic interest rates and show how to apply the model to bond options and foreign currency options. Simulations show that correlation between volatility and the spot asset's price is important for explaining return skewness and strike-price biases in the Black-Scholes (1973) model. The solution technique is based on characteristic functions and can be applied to other problems. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 1993 Oxford University Press},
